Task 2: Secure Cloud Infrastructure - Internee.pk
🛡️ Project Overview
As part of my Cybersecurity internship at Internee.pk, Task 2 focused on strengthening cloud infrastructure security on Microsoft Azure. The objective was to ensure the platform follows industry-standard security measures through auditing, identity management, and traffic filtering.

🚀 Key Implementations
1. Cloud Security Audit
Tool: Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

Action: Performed a comprehensive security audit to evaluate the Secure Score and identify compliance gaps.

Outcome: Analyzed 1 active resource and reviewed recommendations like MFA and vulnerability assessments to align with the Azure Security Benchmark.

2. IAM & Data Redundancy
IAM Policy: Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) by assigning the Reader role to a guest user, following the 'Principle of Least Privilege'.

Backups: Successfully deployed a Recovery Services Vault (vault786) to ensure automated, geo-redundant backups for disaster recovery.

3. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Configuration: Deployed an Azure WAF Policy (Internee-WAF-Policy) in Prevention Mode.

Protection: Specifically configured to protect cloud-based platforms from external threats like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
